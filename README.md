AncestryDNA Workshop: Genomics at Scale
---------------------------------------
Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics

Symposium

### Introduction

To date, over 1.4 million people have taken the Ancestry DNA
test. This amounts to a data set of 1.1 trillion genotypes across
700,000 SNPs. What are effective strategies and techniques for
analyzing and understanding genomic data at this scale? In this short
workshop, two computational biologists at Ancestry, Amir Kermany and
Peter Carbonetto, demonstrate some simple approaches to investigating
and visualizing large-scale genetic data sets, with an emphasis on
practical skills that can be applied to research in human genetics. We
will walk through several interactive examples, so all attendees are
encouraged to bring their laptop (or pair with a friend who has one),
with R ([link](http://cran.r-project.org)) installed beforehand.
Participants are expected to have a basic familiarity with R, since
this is helpful for working through the examples on site.

### Getting started

Install the following packages:

* lattice
* latticeExtra
* Hmisc
* ggplot2
* data.table
